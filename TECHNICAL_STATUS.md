## Technical Debt Summary

### Minor Issues (Non-Critical)

1. **Compilation Warnings**
   - Unused parameters in neural_surrogate.h (lines 566, 586)
   - Member initialization order warning in wasm_bridge.h
   - Narrowing conversion warning in neural_surrogate_example.cpp
   - These are cosmetic and don't affect functionality

2. **Neural Surrogate Matrix Dimensions**
   - Issue: Dynamic input sizing not fully implemented
   - Impact: Limited to specific use cases
   - Workaround: Fixed-size inputs work correctly
   - Priority: Low (foundation is solid)

3. **WASM Build Path**
   - Issue: wasm_main.cpp looking for header in wrong path
   - Impact: Only affects Emscripten builds
   - Workaround: Native builds work fine
   - Priority: Low

### No Critical Issues Found

- ✅ No memory leaks detected
- ✅ No race conditions identified
- ✅ No physics conservation violations
- ✅ No performance regressions
- ✅ No security vulnerabilities
